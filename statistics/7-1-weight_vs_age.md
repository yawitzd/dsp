[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

7-1: Use data from the NSFG to: 

1) Make a scatter plot showing birth weight vs. mother's age.

2) Plot percentiles of birth weight versus mother's age.

3) Compute Pearson's and Spearman's correlations. 

    Pearson's correlation is:  0.0688339703541
        0.07 is near 0, suggesting a non-linear relationship.
     Spearman's correlation is:  0.0946100410966
         0.09 is also near 0, suggesting a non-linear relationship or a lot of outliers.

How would you characterize the relationship between these variables?

    Overall, there is no strong or linear relationship between the two variables.
    Plotting the percentiles of weight vs. mother's age shows that weight seems to increase with age formother's under 22, but as the mother gets older, the effect gets weaker.
